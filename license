I wish I could give a more definiative license.  I'm not sure where the templates that I used originated.  They were provided to me via MarcEdit's bug reporting -- so I'm not sure who to credit.  However, finding transformations related to Unimarc and Marc21 can be a pain, so I offer these.  For my part of this work, I release these changes into the public domain -- and welcome folks to use them as they like.
